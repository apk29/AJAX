This project taught you how to use  $.getJSON &  $.ajax request and error indicators for both.

AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML request, allows to for content retrival and display without reloading the webpage.

The Asynchronous in AJAX refers to the fact the request doesn't block other events from happening and only acts on the data when the server returns it's request. For example, the facebook apps allows you scroll down the page without reloading.

To view this proejct you must copy the files assoicated with this project. Two files that are relavent to this project is the index.html & scripts.js file. They will illustrate how to use the AJAX request the google streetview API and the Wikipedia API.
